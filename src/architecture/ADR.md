# Architectural Decision Records

This document captures the architectural decisions made in the project.

## ADR-001: Adopting TypeScript

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We needed a strong type system to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

**Decision**: Use TypeScript for all application code.

**Consequences**: 
- Positive: Better IDE support, earlier bug detection, improved documentation
- Negative: Steeper learning curve, additional build step

## ADR-002: Component Library Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We needed a consistent UI component library.

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui for core components with Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Accessible components, consistent styling, customizable
- Negative: Additional dependencies, styling complexity

## ADR-003: Data Fetching Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We needed a reliable pattern for fetching and managing data.

**Decision**: Use React Query for data fetching and caching.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Built-in caching, loading/error states, automatic refetching
- Negative: Additional abstraction, learning curve

## ADR-004: State Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We needed to manage global application state.

**Decision**: Use React Context API for global state, with hooks for domain-specific state.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Built into React, simpler than Redux, suits our needs
- Negative: Can lead to context nesting, performance considerations with large state

## ADR-005: Authentication Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We needed a secure authentication system.

**Decision**: Use Supabase Authentication with JWT tokens.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Managed service, secure, handles multiple auth methods
- Negative: External dependency, potential vendor lock-in
