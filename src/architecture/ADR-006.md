# ADR-006: Authentication System Implementation

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
We needed to implement a robust, maintainable authentication system following industry best practices and design patterns. The authentication system needed to handle email/password login, SSO, and registration while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

**Decision**: 
Implement a comprehensive authentication system using several design patterns:

1. **Repository Pattern** - Created an AuthService that abstracts the authentication implementation details.
2. **Facade Pattern** - AuthPage provides a simple interface to the complex authentication subsystem.
3. **Strategy Pattern** - Different validation strategies in the validation utilities.
4. **Command Pattern** - Login/Register actions are encapsulated as objects with standardized execution.
5. **Adapter Pattern** - SSO buttons component provides a consistent interface for different providers.
6. **Builder Pattern** - Registration form builds user accounts step by step with validation.

**Consequences**:

**Positive**:
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Improved maintainability through abstraction
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Consistent interface for different authentication methods
- Strong validation throughout the authentication process
- Type safety with TypeScript and Zod

**Negative**:
- Increased complexity in the initial implementation
- More files to maintain (but with clearer individual responsibilities)
- Additional learning curve for new developers to understand the patterns

**Implementation Notes**:
- Created a dedicated AuthService for all authentication operations
- Centralized validation using Zod schemas
- Implemented robust error handling and loading states
- Added password strength visualization
- Enhanced UI with animations and skeleton loading
