# Core Architecture & Foundation

This document outlines the core architecture and foundational components of the health insights application following the CodeFarm Development Methodology.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, component-based architecture with a focus on maintainability, testability, and scalability. Key architectural patterns include:

1. **Component-Based UI Architecture**
   - Atomic design principles for UI components
   - Separation of container and presentation components
   - Context-based state management for global state

2. **Data Management**
   - Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
   - React Query for server state management
   - Optimistic UI updates for improved perceived performance

3. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
   - Runtime type validation for API responses
   - Strong typing for component props and state

## Foundation Components

The application includes the following foundational components:

### 1. Event Tracking System
- Centralized analytics tracking
- Support for multiple analytics providers
- Standardized event categories and properties
- Queue mechanism for offline tracking

### 2. Feature Flags
- Runtime feature toggling
- User segmentation for gradual rollouts
- Environment-specific feature control
- A/B testing support

### 3. Error Handling
- Centralized error logging
- Error boundaries for UI resilience
- Structured error objects with severity levels
- User-friendly error messages

### 4. Accessibility Framework
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- Keyboard navigation utilities
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode detection

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Component render time tracking
- API request timing
- Resource loading optimization
- User interaction performance metrics

### 6. Internationalization (i18n)
- Multi-language support
- Translation management
- Right-to-left (RTL) text support
- Number and date formatting by locale

### 7. API Layer
- Type-safe API client
- Consistent error handling
- Request caching and deduplication
- Automatic retry mechanisms

### 8. Application State Management
- Persistent application state
- Type-safe state updates
- State migration between versions
- State change tracking

## Architecture Principles

The codebase adheres to the following principles from the CodeFarm methodology:

### Holistic Development

- Focus on both immediate needs and long-term maintainability
- Integration of business requirements with technical implementation

### Continuous Learning
- Adaptable architecture that evolves with new insights
- Performance monitoring for ongoing optimization
- Feature flags for controlled feature rollouts

### User-Centric Design
- Accessibility as a core requirement
- Internationalization for global users
- Performance optimization for better user experience

### Sustainable Code
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type safety throughout the application
- Well-documented architectural decisions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the architecture include:

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: For improved SEO and initial load performance
2. **Micro-Frontend Architecture**: For larger scale applications
3. **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities
4. **Automated Testing Framework**: End-to-end testing infrastructure
5. **GraphQL Integration**: For more efficient data fetching
