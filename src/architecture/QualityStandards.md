# Quality Standards and Code Guidelines

This document outlines the quality standards and coding guidelines for the project, implementing the CritiBot persona from the CodeFarm Development Methodology.

## Code Quality Standards

### 1. TypeScript Usage

- All new code must be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Avoid using `any` type except in exceptional cases
- Use interface for object types and type for unions, intersections, and mapped types
- Export types that are used across files
- Use TypeScript's utility types where appropriate (Pick, Omit, Partial, etc.)

### 2. Component Structure

- Each component should have a single responsibility
- Large components should be broken down into smaller, focused components
- Use proper file structure and organization
- Apply React hooks correctly following the Rules of Hooks
- Use function components with named exports

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo for expensive components that render often
- Apply useCallback for functions passed to child components
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- Implement lazy loading for routes and large components
- Apply virtualization for long lists

### 4. Accessibility Standards

- All components must be keyboard navigable
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Support screen readers
- Handle user preferences (reduced motion, color schemes, etc.)

### 5. Error Handling

- Implement error boundaries at appropriate component levels
- Use structured error objects with consistent properties
- Log errors with proper context
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Include recovery options where possible

## Development Process

### 1. Code Reviews

Code reviews should focus on:
- Adherence to these quality standards
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Maintainability and readability
- Test coverage

### 2. Testing Requirements

- Components must have appropriate unit tests
- Critical user flows must have integration tests
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Include accessibility tests where appropriate

### 3. Documentation

- All components should have JSDoc comments
- Complex functions need explanatory comments
- Architecture decisions should be documented in ADRs
- READMEs should be maintained for major features

### 4. Refactoring Guidelines

- Refactoring should be done in small, focused commits
- Tests must be updated alongside refactored code
- Large refactorings should be broken into smaller tasks
- Performance should be measured before and after

## Tooling and Automation

### 1. Static Analysis

- ESLint with strict TypeScript rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks

### 2. Performance Monitoring

- Use React Profiler to identify performance issues
- Monitor bundle size changes
- Perform regular performance audits

### 3. Accessibility Validation

- Regular automated accessibility testing
- Manual testing with keyboard navigation
- Screen reader validation

## Quality Metrics

We measure quality through several metrics:

1. **Type Coverage**: Percentage of code with proper type definitions
2. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
3. **Accessibility Score**: Results from automated accessibility tests
4. **Bundle Size**: Monitoring JavaScript bundle size
5. **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals measurements
6. **Bug Rate**: Number of bugs reported per release

These standards are continuously evolving as we improve our process and tooling.
