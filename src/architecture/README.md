# CodeFarm Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions and patterns used in the health insights application, following the CodeFarm methodology.

## Core Principles

- **Holistic Development**: Combining technical excellence with strategic thinking
- **Continuous Learning**: Embracing emerging technologies and methodologies
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritizing end-user experience in every development stage
- **Sustainable Code**: Creating maintainable, scalable, and efficient software solutions

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/     # UI components organized by feature
├── contexts/       # React contexts for state management
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── lib/            # Third-party library integrations
├── pages/          # Page components
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/          # Utility functions
└── architecture/   # Architecture documentation
```

## Design Patterns

1. **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separating data fetching from presentation
2. **Context API for State Management**: Using React Context for global state
3. **Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse**: Extracting reusable logic into hooks
4. **Type-Driven Development**: Using TypeScript types to drive implementation

## Data Flow

1. Data is fetched through custom hooks
2. Passed to container components
3. Rendered by presentation components
4. User interactions trigger state updates
5. State changes propagate through the component tree

## Integration Patterns

1. **Health Data Sources**: Consistent adapter pattern for external health data
2. **Authentication**: Centralized auth context with role-based permissions
3. **APIs**: Standardized error handling and response formatting

## Performance Considerations

1. Memoization of expensive calculations
2. Code splitting for page components
3. Lazy loading for non-critical components
4. Optimistic UI updates for improved perceived performance
