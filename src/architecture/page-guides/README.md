# Universal Page Buildout Guide

This directory contains guides and standards for building pages in our application, aligned with the CodeFarm Development Methodology.

## Guide Structure

The page buildout documentation is organized into these focused guides:

- [Page Structure Guide](./PageStructureGuide.md) - Standard page layouts and organization
- [Implementation Patterns](./ImplementationPatterns.md) - Code patterns for different page types
- [Testing Standards](./TestingStandards.md) - Quality assurance checklist for pages
- [Component Structure](./ComponentStructureGuide.md) - Organization of page-specific components
- [Component Patterns](./ComponentPatterns.md) - Reusable component composition patterns
- [Directory Organization](./DirectoryOrganization.md) - File organization standards for pages

Each document provides detailed guidelines and code examples to follow when developing new pages or refactoring existing ones.

## Core Principles

All pages should adhere to these foundational principles from our CodeFarm methodology:

- **Holistic Development**: Combine technical excellence with strategic thinking
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize end-user experience in every development stage
- **Sustainable Code**: Create maintainable, scalable, and efficient software solutions
- **Continuous Learning**: Embrace emerging technologies and methodologies

## Implementation Process

Follow this process for all new pages:

1. **Planning**
   - Review requirements
   - Identify components and data needs
   - Plan page structure

2. **Component Development**
   - Create/reuse components
   - Follow established patterns
   - Test components in isolation

3. **Page Integration**
   - Implement routing
   - Connect to APIs
   - Add state management
   - Implement error handling

4. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Verify functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Optimize performance
   - Refine interactions

5. **Documentation**
   - Add code comments
   - Update documentation
   - Document limitations
