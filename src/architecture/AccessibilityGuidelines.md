# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines our approach to accessibility following the CodeFarm Development Methodology, emphasizing user-centric design principles.

## Core Principles

1. **Perceivable**: Information and UI components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: UI components and navigation must be operable by all users.
3. **Understandable**: Information and operation of the UI must be understandable to all users.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Implementation Requirements

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement proper focus management, especially in modals and dialogs
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Support standard keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns
- Implement skip links for keyboard users

### Screen Reader Support

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers
- Test with common screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Implement live regions for important status updates

### Visual Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum WCAG AA compliance)
- Do not rely solely on color to convey information
- Support dark mode and high contrast mode
- Make text resizable without breaking layouts
- Ensure form fields have visible labels

### Content Structure

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
- Structure content logically
- Implement proper landmarks (main, nav, aside, etc.)
- Use lists for list content
- Make tables accessible with proper headers

### Images and Media

- Include alternative text for all images
- Provide captions and transcripts for video content
- Ensure media controls are accessible
- Avoid auto-playing media with sound
- Support reduced motion preferences

### Forms and Validation

- Associate labels with form controls
- Provide clear error messages
- Place error messages in close proximity to fields
- Use `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` for error states
- Support form navigation with keyboard

## Testing Process

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Use tools like axe-core for automated accessibility testing
   - Integrate accessibility tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up linting rules for accessibility issues

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test with keyboard only navigation
   - Test with screen readers
   - Test color contrast and zoom levels
   - Test form completion and error handling
   - Test with various assistive technologies

3. **User Testing**
   - Conduct testing with users who have disabilities
   - Gather feedback on accessibility issues
   - Prioritize and address reported issues

## Tools and Resources

1. **Development Tools**
   - axe DevTools for browser testing
   - WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
   - Accessibility Insights
   - eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

2. **Learning Resources**
   - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
   - MDN Web Docs on Accessibility
   - A11Y Project
   - Inclusive Design Patterns by Heydon Pickering
