# ADR-007: Quality Assurance and Optimization Framework

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
As part of the CodeFarm Development Methodology, we need to implement a comprehensive Quality Assurance and Optimization framework to ensure code quality, performance, and reliability. This represents the CritiBot persona which focuses on quality control and technical excellence.

**Decision**: 
Implement a multi-layered quality assurance system with the following components:

1. **Automated Code Quality Tools**
   - Standardized ESLint configuration with strict TypeScript rules
   - Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Husky pre-commit hooks to enforce quality checks

2. **Performance Optimization Patterns**
   - React.memo for expensive component rendering
   - useCallback and useMemo for optimized function and value caching
   - Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
   - Virtualization for long lists with react-window

3. **Error Handling Architecture**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries at strategic component levels
   - Centralized error logging service
   - User-friendly error states with recovery options

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - Custom test utilities and fixtures
   - Mock service worker for API testing
   - End-to-end testing infrastructure

5. **Accessibility Standards**
   - ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Color contrast compliance
   - Screen reader compatibility

**Consequences**:

**Positive**:
- Improved code reliability and maintainability
- Enhanced performance across the application
- Better user experience during error scenarios
- Consistent quality standards across the codebase
- Improved accessibility for all users

**Negative**:
- Increased initial development time due to quality requirements
- Learning curve for developers to adhere to strict standards
- Potential overhead in maintaining extensive test coverage

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create utility libraries for common performance optimization techniques
- Implement error boundary components with consistent UI treatment
- Develop testing utilities to simplify test implementation
- Use React Profiler to identify and address performance bottlenecks
