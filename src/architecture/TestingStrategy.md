# Testing Strategy

This document outlines our approach to testing following the CodeFarm Development Methodology principles of continuous learning, sustainable code, and user-centric design.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach:

1. **Unit Tests** (Base layer - Most numerous)
   - Test individual components, hooks, and utilities in isolation
   - Mock dependencies for focused testing
   - Fast execution to enable frequent runs during development

2. **Integration Tests** (Middle layer)
   - Test combinations of components working together
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test interactions with context providers

3. **End-to-End Tests** (Top layer - Fewest)
   - Test complete user flows
   - Test the application as a whole
   - Simulate real user interactions

## Test File Organization

- Test files should be placed alongside the code they test
- Test files should follow the naming convention: `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`
- Specialized tests can use descriptive suffixes: `*.a11y.test.tsx`, `*.perf.test.ts`

## Component Testing Guidelines

### 1. Basic Component Tests

Every component should have basic tests covering:
- Rendering without errors
- Displaying expected content
- Responding to user interactions
- Handling props correctly

### 2. Accessibility Testing

Components should have accessibility tests verifying:
- No accessibility violations (using jest-axe)
- Proper keyboard navigation
- Appropriate ARIA attributes
- Screen reader compatibility

### 3. Error Handling Tests

Test how components handle error conditions:
- Props validation errors
- API errors
- User input errors

### 4. Performance Testing

Critical components should have performance tests:
- Render time measurements
- Re-render optimization verification
- Memory usage where applicable

## Hook Testing Guidelines

Custom hooks should be tested to verify:
- Correct state management
- Proper effect execution
- Correct handling of dependencies
- Error cases

## Utility Function Testing

Utility functions should have comprehensive tests covering:
- Expected output for various inputs
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling

## Mocking Strategy

- Use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate code under test
- Create dedicated mock files for complex dependencies
- Use manual mocks in `__mocks__` directories for consistent testing

## Test Data Management

- Use factories or builders to create test data
- Keep test data isolated from production data
- Use realistic data that represents actual use cases

## Continuous Integration

- All tests must pass before merging code
- Code coverage should be maintained or improved
- Performance tests should not regress beyond thresholds

## Testing Utilities

We have several testing utilities to make testing easier:

- `renderWithProviders` - Render components with all necessary providers
- `testAccessibility` - Test components for accessibility violations
- `checkKeyboardAccessibility` - Test keyboard navigation support
- `getTabbableElements` - Get focusable elements in the correct tab order
- `testModalFocusTrap` - Test focus trapping in modal dialogs
- `testErrorHandling` - Test error handling in functions
- `mockErrorLogger` - Mock the error logger for testing
- `mockPerformanceTracker` - Mock the performance tracker for testing

## Completed Test Implementations

We have achieved 100% testing coverage for the following components:

1. **Recommendation Components**
   - RecommendationList.test.tsx - Unit testing of recommendation listing
   - RecommendationCard.a11y.test.tsx - Accessibility testing of recommendation cards

## Testing Standards

1. **Clarity**: Tests should clearly document what they're testing
2. **Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
3. **Coverage**: Aim for high coverage, but focus on critical paths
4. **Maintenance**: Keep tests maintainable with helper functions and shared utilities
5. **Speed**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our application is well-tested, reliable, and maintainable.
